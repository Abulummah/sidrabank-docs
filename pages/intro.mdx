# Welcome to Sidra Bank

The premier destination for digital Islamic banking. Our vision is to create the world's largest decentralized Islamic DEFI platform.

At Sidra Bank, we understand the importance of adhering to Islamic principles in financial transactions. As one of the five pillars of Islam, zakat plays a significant role in the way Muslims approach money. This is why we have created a platform that addresses the unique concerns of Muslim investors in the digital currency market.

Our platform is designed to provide answers to questions such as:

- Is it halal or haram to acquire digital currencies?
- Is it permissible to speculate in digital currencies?
- What are the permissible and forbidden currencies?
- How can we ensure the legitimacy of the currencies we trade with?
- How is zakat calculated for digital currency holdings?

Sidra Bank is committed to providing a trading platform that is based on advanced technology and compliant with Islamic law. We offer alternatives to traditional trading practices such as leveraged financial products, margin trading, and mortgages that are not permissible under Islamic law.
